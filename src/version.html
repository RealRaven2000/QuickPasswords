					Added Backup / restore feature
					<br> <img src="img/Backup.png" alt="Backup and  Restore buttons"/>
					<p>This was quite a complicated implementation (probably 2 weeks of coding), 
						 but hopefully it was worth it. I started to write this after I managed 
						 to delete all my sync'ed passwords one night when I visited a friend and tried to 
						 log in from his machine. Somehow this propagated quickly to my 
						 home machine from the Sync store so I had to restore an older profile. Since Sync 
						 doesn't explain where it takes "the latest password state" from and there is no 
						 "yesterday's good logins" I decided it was time to support a local backup.</p>
					<p>However there are some stipulations. First of all I never want QuickPasswords
						 to be the one simple way to steal your friend's passwords, so the backup / restore
						 features are protected with the master password. If you haven't set one, that's 
						 too bad, no backup for you. Secondly, we cannot have files full of unencrypted passwords
						 on some local storage. It's just not safe at all. So by default, I am using Firefox
						 built in keystore which is a unique personalized encryption platform generated 
						 when you create a new Firefox profile or install Firefox for the first time.
						 </p>
					<br> <img src="img/encryption-reminder.png" alt="Encryption Reminder"/>
					<p>This also means that you won't be able to restore the passwords on another Firefox
						/ Profile unless you have a copy of the same keystore. 
						Same is stored in a file called key3.db and should be backed up somewhere to 
						read the passwords again. If you loose or break this file 
						you will also simply not be able to read your passwords on your Firefox anymore.
						As long as you use the same Firefox on the same Computer this won't present
						a problem unless there is a file corruption. To transfer to a different
						machine simply copy the relevant profile folder or at least key3.db.</p>
					<p>All of these stipulations aside, there as a couple of things that the new backup
						restore does well (and may be better than others). First of all, when you restore
						your passwords, there is one thing it does NOT do: it will not DELETE all your
						passwords. Instead it will merge in the passwords, carefully checking the backed up
						logins and the time stamps (when was it last changed). If you want to start from zero, 
						you have to delete all passwords manually. (Make sure to back up beforehand!)</p>
					<br> <img src="img/modify-prompt.png" alt="Password Modification Prompt"/>
					<p>Modified passwords: Restore will only <i>change</i> a password if it
						wasn't changed in the meantime. This way you won't accidentally overwrite
						a password you may have changed online into an older version. 
						However, if this is what you <i>actually want</i> to do with a particular login,
						[maybe because a password change online didn't propagate into the web]
						you can simply delete that one manually before doing the restore.</p>
					<p>File handling: you can store your files wherever you like, but I would still recommend
						not putting them on a public folder or shared drive, unless you have set up 
						correct access permissions. Better safe than sorry!
					<br> <img src="img/restore-results.png" alt="Results after Restore"/>
